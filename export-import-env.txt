This is how you can use one project env to new project (because in that case you don't have to import every packages again)

- first go to the project activate stage eg  conda activate C:\Users\Riya\Desktop\machine-learning-old
- then export the env                    eg  conda env export > environment.yml 


(The ".yml" extension typically denotes a file written in YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files and data exchange in software development.)


now it's to use this export data to machine-learning-new

- first go to the project activate stage        eg  conda activate C:\Users\Riya\Desktop\machine-learning-old
- then make the new file                        eg  mkdir machine-learning-new
- go to file directery and write this command   eg  conda env create --prefix ./env -f environment.yml
 *(make sure environment.yml file is already in machine-learning-new)



you are ready to go , happy coding
